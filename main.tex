 \textbf{\textit{Abstract}—In the area of high performance computing (HPC), parallel benchmarks are constantly used to explore and evaluate the performance of heterogeneous computing systems on the horizon. 
Most previous and related work concentrates on measuring the performance of emerging heterogeneous architectures that consist of multi-core CPU, GPU and Intel Xeon Phi architectures, while other factors such as 
power consumption, efficiency and cost are considered as less important metrics.  
In this paper, we report our systematical evaluation of five representative benchmarks of Rodinia on modern CPU, GPU, and Intel Xeon Phi in terms of performance, 
power consumption, temperature, productivity and monetary cost. 
We propose a unified metric that combines those results as a means for overall comparison of the three architectures. 
The metric helps users to comprehensively evaluate heterogeneous architecture from both software and hardware perspectives.}

\textbf{\textit{Keywords}—Performance analysis, heterogeneous architecture, benchmark suite, power consumption, temperature, productivity, Xeon Phi coprocessor, Nvidia GPU}
